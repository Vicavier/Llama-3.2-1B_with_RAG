The target of this analysis is to find the connection between patient age, sex, condition, the drug they use, and their satisfaction rating of the drug, then use this connection to predict the satisfaction rating of a drug given patient age, sex, condition and recommend the top 3 satisfaction rated drugs to the patient. We assume that, this connection exits, so that the prediction we made will be of some use.
The dataset we use is WebMD Drug Reviews Dataset. Data was acquired by scraping WebMD site. There are around 0.36 million rows of unique reviews and is updated till Mar 2020. It covers 1806 different conditions and 7093 different drugs. And it can be downloaded on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanharode07/webmd-drug-reviews-dataset.
The model we are using is one-fully-connected-layer neural network, and we ignore the combination of condition and drug that occurs less than 10 times in the dataset to remove rare cases. We use embedding layer to map discreet gender, drugs and conditions to vectors. Then feed them into a fully-connected-layer neural network. The original variance of satisfaction rating is 2.58, after training, the predicted MSE of satisfaction rating is 2.3, which indicate that the model somehow fits the data.
